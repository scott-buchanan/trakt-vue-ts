# Vue 3 with Trakt, TMDB, OMDb and fanart.tv

Personal project to get more familiar with Vue 3. Using Trakt, TMDB, fanart, OMDb API's.

- View Trakt trending shows/movies
- View Trakt shows recommended by you
- View episode watched history
- Search for TV Shows and Movies (with autocomplete). This includes autocomplete dropdown as well as a search page with results if you hit enter to search.
- Rate episodes, shows, movies (Trakt)
- Read Reviews (and replies) for episodes, shows, movies
- View list of actors for episodes, shows, movies
- View watched progress of TV shows (overall and per season)
- Mobile support (this will be ongoing as things change)

## Upcoming features
- TV Show seasons section, list episodes per season with details, watched status, ability to rate, set watched etc.
- Write reviews
- Rate episode/show/movie will also push to TMDB
- Actors section (instead of linking off to IMDb)

More will be added to this list as I think of things to add.
